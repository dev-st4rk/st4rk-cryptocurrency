# St4rk Cryptocurrency

This code was developed in C++, and I did it with the intention of helping me understand the concepts of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
The code was based on content provided by the youtube channels: Dev Tech Guy and Simply Explained. Of which they have great didactics in the tutorials.
